# mammoreplicator
This repository contains the source code of the _mammoreplicator_ software described in the article: Andreu Badal, Matthew Clark, Bahaa Ghammraoui, "Reproducing two-dimensional mammograms with three-dimensional printed phantoms", Journal of Medical Imaging 5, p. 033501 (2018). The software was initially introduced at the SPIE Medical Imaging 2016 conference.

The code reads dicom images (using the http://www.pydicom.org/ library) and outputs a triangle mesh file in PLY format. Sample dicom mammography images can be downloaded at http://deckard.mc.duke.edu/~samei/tg18_files/TG18-MM-dcm.zip
