# mammoreplicator
Replicating 2D mammograms with 3D printed surrogates

Currently this code reads only dicom images (using the http://www.pydicom.org/ library) and outputs a triangle mesh file in PLY format. Sample dicom images can be downloaded at http://deckard.mc.duke.edu/~samei/tg18_files/TG18-MM-dcm.zip

This code is still under development and not fitted for any serious use!!
